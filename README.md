Comparison of monthly MSCI World Index monthly index closure prices for 36 countries. Testing the hypothesis that returns, on average, are higher during November-Arpril months than in May-October. OLS becomes a mean variance test, as we are measureing differences in the mean.

The data indicates satistical significance (p => 10%) in 7 countries; Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Indonesia, Korea and Portugal.

The results produced are: 

- 36 regressions: for each country in the sample. Monthly returns are regressed against a dummy variable (1 if month is November-April and 0 if month is May-October).
